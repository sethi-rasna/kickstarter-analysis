# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Earlier this year, Loiuse ran a kickstarter campaign for her play "Fever" which fell a little short of its goal. We decided to take a look at Kickstarter data from past campaigns to see what the most advantageous time for her to retry a pitch would be. 

### Purpose

To provide indepth analysis of previous kickstarter campaigns to provide context as to best practices.

## Analysis and Challenges

Drilling down the data, we were able to pinpoint theater campaigns and provide specific analysis for Louise based on her specific project. Although she is in a particular region, Great Britain, we provide analysis for theater and play campaigns all over the world. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
