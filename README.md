# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Earlier this year, Loiuse ran a kickstarter campaign for her play "Fever" which fell a little short of its goal. We decided to take a look at Kickstarter data from past campaigns to see what the most advantageous time for her to retry a pitch would be. 

### Purpose

To provide indepth analysis of previous kickstarter campaigns to provide context as to best practices.

## Analysis and Challenges

Drilling down the data, we were able to pinpoint theater campaigns and provide specific analysis for Louise based on her specific project. Although she is in a particular region, Great Britain, we provide analysis for theater and plays campaigns all over the world. It would be great to work with a larger data set but we were able to pull some concrete analysis from the dataset provided.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

We were able to find that it seems as though April through May would be the best launch date interval for theater campaigns based on our analysis. Furthermore, most campaigns failed in the months between September and November. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

It seems although the most successful campaigns raised between $5000 and $10000. Campaigns of more than $50000 failed the most often. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

As previously mentioned, it would be been best to work with a larger dataset and given more time, we could have provided more in depth analysis specifically on the plays subcategory in this dataset. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
   
    Two conclusions that can be drawn from the Outcomes based on Launch Date data are it seems like the sping time is the best time to start a campaiagn for theater       projects and the fall seems to be the worst time to launch a campaign. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
     
     It is best to have a campaign with a lower target goal, most specifically between $5000 and $10000, than to have a larger goal, such as $50000 or more.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

     Kickstarter is not the only platform to raise money for campaigns; therefore, it would have been better to look at data from multiple platforms to compare and  
     contrast which ones would have been best for Theater and/or play campaigns. Additionally, Kickstarter is a relatively new platofrm so the data we have from the 
     platform isn't historical. There are other ways to crowd source funds for plays so it might have been worth looking at those options as well in our research.
     
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

     If given more time, we could have looked at the outcome of plays specifically instead of just theaters. We could have also looked more specifically at Great 
     Britain plays and got more situational data to look at.
